Hi! I'm a child of God, a husband and father, an economist, and a data scientist. 

This website is a place where I gather and present informal thoughts as well as more formal work I've done in academia. As the name suggests, I'm shooting for innovation over perfection. Thanks for checking it out, and please leave me a comment, screed, correction or contribution!
