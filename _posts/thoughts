The purpose of the commune is to make an easier place for folks to be self-sufficient, conditional on whatever they can get from the government.

The question is whether and how well an operator can create those conditions with little or no accounting loss. 

Reference "Automating Inequality" for a treatment of the problems with means-tested benefits. Some of the strategies the government has pursued to help poor people: 1. Non-means tested benefits that are expensive but unpalatable for folks with another choice. The poor house. Gets abusive when people are coerced into being there.
2. Means tested benefits that are expensive. Twists people's incentives (eg, discouraging marriage) and either hurts productivity (eg, work disincentives) or increases measured productivity but hurts utility (eg, mothers in the workforce with children in bad child care).
3. Free-market policies that are inexpensive but increase income inequality while increasing absolute income.
