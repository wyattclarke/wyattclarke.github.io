title: What's Really Behind "Modern Monetary Theory"
---

I'm not really into conspiracy theories but...here's my juicy conspiracy theory: The Left and the Right are in cahoots to sink the dollar.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a far left US Representative from New York, helped popularize in 2019 a heterodox macroeconomic theory called Modern Monetary Theory. The takeaway from MMT is that the US government can pay for whatever it wants by printing more money. You can read a full explanation on Wikipedia.

"Heterodox" is what mainstream economists call a bullshit idea. But for the past 5 years, under Republican and Democrat control, printing money is exactly how the US has dealt with its problems. It's not a new idea. Every incidence of runaway inflation you'll read about was preceded by the government printing money to pay for what it wants: pre-WWII Germany, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and more. So why has such a spectacularly reckless idea become the bi-partisan consensus in Washington...?

First, the non-controversial part. Inflation is sometimes called a "wealth tax." The way we normally think of taxes, the government takes people's buying power by taking away part of their money. With inflation, the government (by creating too much money) takes people's buying power by making their money worth less.

It's no big mystery why the Left wants wealth taxes. Their more extreme members campaign on promising a wealth tax. What's harder to explain is why the Right also wants a wealth tax. There are two reasons. 

First, a wealth tax via inflation falls proportionally on everyone holding the currency. Fortunes all over the world are held in dollars; that's why we call the US Dollar the world's "reserve currency." **So US Dollar inflation funds the government partially by taking away foreigners' buying power. Sweet deal!**

The trouble is, we can only get away with a wealth tax once - which is why Republicans typically oppose wealth taxes (or why they claim to). After getting burned by US Dollar inflation, the rest of the world will eventually find new ways to store their wealth, ending the US Dollar's reserve currency status. 

Losing reserve currency status is a policymaker's nightmare, especially for Republicans. So why are they willing to risk it? Here's the second reason: The US Dollar's reserve currency status is doomed anyway.
