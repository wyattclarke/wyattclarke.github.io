title: Pool Your Student Loans to Build a Frat House!
---

This article imagines how an organization could raise capital for real estate to house college students by pooling students' access to guaranteed government loans. It is inspired by the Korean system of Jeonse. From Wikipedia, 

"Jeonse (전세), also known as Key Money Deposit or Key Money, is a real estate term unique to South Korea that refers to the way apartments are leased. Instead of paying monthly rent, a renter will make a lump-sum deposit on a rental space, at anywhere from 50% to 80% of the market value."

Jeonse originated when Korean landlords lacked access to banking capital, so they raised capital from residents. Now that banking capital is more readily available in Korea, Jeonse is dying out. But we can imagine how a similar system could be used in America where students have guaranteed access to capital via government student loans.

I'm thinking of situations where a capital-constrained organization with limited access to bank loans invests in real estate to house college students with access to government loans. That could include:

- College students who want to buy a house for their fraternity or sorority, without a capital endowment
- A newly formed, capital-constrained college buying an existing college campus
- A new residential community formed to house online college students

The most typical approach when raising capital for housing is for the housing developer to use a bank loan. The developer buys the building with a mortgage loan and charges rent to cover the payments. 

While uncommon in college housing, another common real estate financing scheme for shared housing is a condominium. In a condominium, residents buy shares in the building. The table below contrasts typical rentals, condominiums, and Jeonse rental.
