Goal: Provide a new schooling option for co-op and condo dwellers near the Fleetwood Train station in Westchester County, New York. Raise property prices by increasing demand from families with school age children.
 
Setting: Areas of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, New York within walking distance of the Fleetwood train station, along Cross County Parkway. That includes the 10708 ZIP code served by Yonkers schools and the Fleetwood neighborhood, served by Mount Vernon schools. 
 
Most housing is owner-occupied co-ops and condos. Housing is high quality and expensive, but public schools are mediocre or bad. Few families send their kids to the neighborhood public school. Families mostly move to nearby school districts when kids reach school age, find some niche in the public schools, or enroll in private school. 
 
Only 11 percent of the population is school age (between 5-17 years of age), compared with x percent nationwide, 20 percent in less-wealthy parts of Mount Vernon and Yonkers, and 40 percent in Bronxville with its elite public schools.
 
The child population is a diverse mix of black, white, and Hispanic with sizable numbers of immigrants in each racial group. Many families of color who could afford housing in better school districts resist the move since they fear their children will feel alienated in an overwhelmingly white setting. 
 
From March to June 2020, public schools in the area closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Parents became more directly involved in their children’s education. This experience could increase long-term demand for alternative, do-it-yourself schooling models such as homeschooling "pods".
