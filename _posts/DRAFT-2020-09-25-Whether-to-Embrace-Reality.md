title: Is Reality Worth Embracing?
---

I binge watched a Netflix show recently for 35 hours over two weeks. As a father of three, that's not healthy. What the hell was I thinking? Simply, it was fun and the consequences were tomorrow's problem. 

It occurred to me, in the two weeks I took to commit this crime, that drug addicts must feel similarly. Not the physical effects of addiction, of course, but the struggle between willful ignorance of future consequences and...embracing reality.
