title: Name and Shame Litterbug Stores
---

Yonkers, New York is dirty. It's where I live, and there is literally trash everywhere - every gutter, every forest, every highway. Most of it has a corporate logo. This article is a proposal to motivate (name, shame, blackmail) stores to pick up after their customers.  

I often wish for a way to hold litterbugs accountable. Imagine grabbing one by the collar and making her pick that damn Dunkin' cup back up off the sidewalk. (I did catch somebody once. It was thrilling.) Unfortunately, it's rare to catch somebody in the act of littering. But it's usually easy to know from where the litter came based on its corporate logo.




- Solution based on capitalism, not police power
- Whether it's the corporations' fault doesn't matter to me
