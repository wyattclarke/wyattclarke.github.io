title: Where to Raise My Kids
---

I'm a white man from Indiana and my wife is a black woman from Namibia. We have three kids. They're gorgeous.

Neither my wife nor I have experience growing up and being viewed as black in the US. I hear it can be toxic, and we've got to decide where to live.

Since 2018, we've lived in Yonkers, NY near the Fleetwood Metro North station. The place has [warts](https://wyattclarke.github.io/Litterbugs/), but we've found a lot to love. In particular, the economic and cultural distance between black, white, and other residents feels minimal relative to other places we've been. There's less of a gulf between racial groups.

I've spent lots of energy trying to figure out what feels different here. Some of my ideas are:
- Racially, it's majority black and white (less Asian and Hispanic). But there is so much ethnic diversity within each racial group that skin color is a bad predictor for how people will act or how much money they have. There are recent immigrant communities from Armenia, Ireland, the Caribbean, Africa, etc. 
- The New York Metro Area is all pretty diverse. We can go far before my family feels out of place. Our neighborhood isn't some isolated nook, surrounded by inhospitable places.
- Most adult residents are professionals, regardless of skin color. 

Though we like where we live, it's always interesting to consider alternatives. What I want to do here is choose a few metrics from Census data that I hope capture the magic of the Fleetwood neighborhood. Then, by comparing to other places in the US, perhaps we can find other places with the same magic - and hopefully lower house prices, lower taxes, warmer winters, and better public schools.
