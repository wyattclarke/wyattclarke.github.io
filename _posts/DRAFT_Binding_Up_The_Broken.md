title: Binding Up the Broken in Capitalism

Imagine one's life as a night in the casino. Some players finish rich and others poor. Success depends on a combination of skill, sobriety and luck. Unequal outcomes determined by luck seem unfair, but it's hard to reduce the effect of luck without also lessening the importance of skill and sobriety.

Now, the casino is open night after night. If the players each night were unrelated to those from the night before, it would be anyone's guess who might win. On the other hand, if the same folks showed up every night (maybe they're vampires?), things might get predictable.
