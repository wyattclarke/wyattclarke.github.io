title: Binding Up the Broken in Capitalism
---

Imagine one's life as a night in the casino. Some players finish rich and others poor. Success depends on a combination of skill, sobriety and luck. Unequal outcomes determined by luck seem unfair, but it's hard to reduce the effect of luck without also lessening the importance of skill and sobriety.

Now, the casino I'm imagining is open night after night. If there were new players each night, strangers to those from the night before, it would be anyone's guess who might win. Exciting! On the other hand, if the same folks showed up every night, things would get predictable. Each night, the same skilled players would get richer, fleecing those same poor devils every night. A stroke of luck - good or bad - could have consequences lasting many nights. Some people might stop trying and just sit in the corner nursing a drink.
