title: Binding Up the Broken in Capitalism
---

Imagine one's life as a night in the casino. Some players finish rich and others poor. Success depends on a combination of skill, sobriety and luck. Unequal outcomes determined by luck seem unfair, but it's hard to reduce the effect of luck without also lessening the importance of skill and sobriety.

Now, the casino I'm imagining is open night after night. If there were new players each night, it would be anyone's guess who might win. Exciting! On the other hand, if the same folks showed up every night, things would get predictable...and sort of depressing. In the games of skill, the best players would nearly always win, taking home everybody else's grocery money night after night. In the games of chance, a stroke of bad luck could sideline a player permanently. After a while, many of the players might not even really play - instead sitting silently off to the side, nursing a drink and watching the game.

Real life is somewhere in the middle between these scenarios. The "casino" of life has new players every night, but they are relatives of those from the night before - inheriting education, culture, DNA, and hopefully some money. Though America fancies itself as _the land of opportunity_, inter-generational income mobility is [depressingly low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility#Intergenerational_mobility) in our recent history. A frightening share of people have lost hope and stopped trying. 

How should one help these inveterate gamblers in the casino? Arguments can and should be had about appropriate policies to limit how luck impacts success
