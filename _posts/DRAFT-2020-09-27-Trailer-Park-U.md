Whatever I might have learned during college was received in roughly equal parts from professors in the classroom and peers outside the classroom. I gained access to these two communities as a package deal by enrolling in a residential college, at Purdue University. 

Today, online education seems like the future for many students. With it, the package deal of formal and informal education is being unbundled. Online schools might challenge their students in the classroom, but they cannot stretch students' minds with late night debates between friends in a coffee shop. This post imagines a residential institution for online college students to fill that gap, by living and learning together. An [art colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_colony) of sorts.

Some goals I have in mind are:
 - Launch successful adult careers and lives, not limited to success in college
 - Accomodate residents' kids and partners
 - Most students' net worth should increase during their time as residents, whether or not they graduate
 - Residential models should be scalable, up or down depending on demand
 - Produce entrepreneurs and opportunity for rural communities
 - Avoid drug use, sexual abuse, and abuse of power

It would start by embedding in a friendly institution that would take up this goal, support me and my family, and have access to cheap ample housing for students. Some places that come to mind are:
- [Koinonia Farm](https://www.koinoniafarm.org/) in Georgia
- [Jesus People USA](https://jesuspeoplechicago.org/) in Chicago
- [The Bean Path](https://thebeanpath.org/) in Jackson, MS
- [The Bruderhof](https://www.bruderhof.com/) in upstate New York
- Hailey Dady's flower farm near Lafayette, IN
- Catholic Charities
- A college with too much dormitory capacity
 
Students would be provided the wrap-around services of a residential college, but their training would be an online program in which they enroll themselves. Areas of study should be flexible, but focused on topics where there is advisor expertise and local economic support. Services would include a work-study job in a business owned by Trailer Park U, a childcare co-op that heavily relies on parents' contributions, a cafeteria, academic advising, and study groups. Advisors would help students navigate training resources available on the internet and encourage entrepreneurialism.
