title: What is God's Economy?
---

My pastor is fond of saying, "God's economy is different from the world's economy." It never sits well with me. What does that mean?

We economists get defensive around anybody who say the laws of economics don't apply to their particular situation. Whether it's a corporation, a school, a country, or a communal pot farm - the laws of economics always apply. It is what it is. Ignore the reality of how people interact, and a rational agent is going to bite you in the ass.

These "rational agents" we talk about in economics are self-interested decision makers. They are strategists, all trying to live as happily as possible - however they each define happiness. The agents may interact and trade in harmony, but each one is only looking out for themself.

Jesus talks about the world in starkly different terms. He says, “Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another." (John 13:34). And, "I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you." (John 14:20) "Let the little children come to me [...] for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." (Mark 10:14)

In Jesus' view of the world, everything is about family. We are God's children; Jesus is our older brother; the Church is the bride of Christ. The very nature of God is about family - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - three people who somehow form one God. 




people are related - to each other and to God. Everything is phrased in terms of interdependent relationships

Smaller and smaller households
The love of most will grow cold. 
The world is the devil's. 




We frame people this way because it's simple, and it pretty much works. Why complicate?
