title: "How Do They Do That?!" Challenge
---

I woke up this morning and watched a [video from Neuralink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsCul1sp4hQ) of a monkey playing a computer game with its brain. How on God's green Earth do they do that!?

The thing is, I know what's going in that video - or at least many parts of the story. And I suspect many of you readers do too. I could never have done it, but I can explain many aspects to a high schooler. 

I propose an open source wiki-curriculum challenge where contributors add content (videos, articles, or interactive activities) to help a 15 year old student learn about everything happening in that video. It's rich territory to introduce topics. I can imagine lessons on:

* Neuralink technology
  * Neural networks and the foundational topics to understand how they work
  * Brain anatomy
  * Biomedical engineering of the device
* How we came to be testing on monkeys
  * History of how humans understand monkeys and other intelligent species
  * Ethics of animal testing
  * Biologically, why do we choose pigs and monkeys for testing?
* The society that engendered this moment
  * Why would you start a company?
  * Why work for a startup vs a corporation?
  * Impacts of immigration (Musk is South African)
  * Why is the company in Silicon Valley?
* The tech that brought this video to your screen
  * How is video created?
  * How the internet brings it to your screen?

I'm going to try creating a few lessons. I hope you'll help!
